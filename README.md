# ChromaticDoodles
This C# application creates abstract paintings. 
It has a toolbar and a drawing area. In the drawing area, a specified number of geometric shapes are randomly generated: lines, triangles, ellipses, rectangles, Bezier curves, etc.
The areas between the generated shapes can be colored in different colors using the tools in the toolbar.
The application allows the user to save and print the paintings. 
There is also a tool available that allows the user to determine the amount of ink required to print a painting of a given size before printing. The calculation is done by knowing the amount of ink required for one square centimeter.
